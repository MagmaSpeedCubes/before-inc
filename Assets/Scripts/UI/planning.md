Operation: Policies to keep authority running

Authority: 
Support 1
Brief world leaders on the importance of rapidly identifying and responding to climate change. Slightly increases Support. 

Support 2
Broadcast global plea for international cooperation and coordination to successfully mitigate the effects of climate change. Significantly increases Support.

Support 3
Emphasise the global threat facing humanity and urge everyone to do whatever it takes to prevent catastrophic warming. Very significantly increases Support.

Education 1
Promote information on global warming to encourage people to support the climate movement. Increases Support over time.

Education 2
Create and distribute curricula on climate change to educate students on global warming. Increases Support over time.



Censorship
Heavily restrict communications to prevent public criticism of climate mitigation. Support frozen for 1 month. Decreases Support.

Fake News
Create and disseminate misinformation to disguise strategic failures. Support frozen for 1 month. Significantly decreases Support.



Economic: 
Taxes I
Increase taxes on the ultra wealthy. Increases future funding.
Unlockable by default, Unlocks Carbon Credits and Increased Taxes II


Taxes II
Increase taxes on the upper-middle class. Increases future funding. Decreases support, especially in wealthy countries.

Taxes III
Increases taxes on the middle class. Increases future funding. Decreases support. 

Taxes IV
Significantly increases taxes on the entire population. Increases future funding. Significantly decreases support.


Carbon Credits
Provide credits to groups for removal of greenhouse gases. Decreases emissions, especially in wealthy regions.

Carbon Tax
Implement a tax on large amounts of carbon emissions. Decreases emissions and increases funding. Decreases support, especially in poor regions.

Scenarios

Green Future - Normal

Skepticism - Start with less support, funding
Urban Sprawl - Environment starts weakened
Economic Growth - Emissions increase over time
Oligarchy - earn less funding, policies more politically charged
Climate Denial - Start with much less support
